			<h3>Article 1</h3>
			<p>
				I am not sure what to write for this article but this is my stream of conciouseness so I am going to keep typing for a little but longer.
			</p>
			<p>
				I still have not decided what to put as my first article.
			</p>

			<h3>Article 2</h3>
			<p>
				In this next section I am thinking about writting a list.  Maybe one that is numbers like I am instructing you on steps on how to do something.  Maybe like a recipe or workout plan or something like that.  We will see what I come up with.
			</p>
			<h4>List items</h4>
			<aside>Lets talk about how to make a PB & J</aside>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Get out ingredients.
					<ul>
						<li>2 piece of bread</li>
						<li>peanut butter</li>
						<li>jelly</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Spread desired ammount of peanut butter on one slice of bread.</li>
				<li>Spread desired ammount of jelly on the other slice of bread.</li>
				<li>Press the two piece of bread together (sides with PB and J together).</li>
			</ol>
		</article>

			<h3>Article 3</h3>
			<p>
				Down here I was thinking about putting a slideshow of pictures.  Should the user have to push a button for it to go or should it be on a timer? What should the photos be of?  How big should they be?  All good questions...
				Definately going to use jquery for this.
